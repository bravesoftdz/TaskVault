# TaskVault
A ToDo list program made in PascalABC.NET

Now instead of having a ToDo notepad on your desk, you can just use this program, made by me.

It's size is **lesser than a megabyte**, which makes it be very compact and perfect for you to use that space for your ideas ;)

It's distributed under the BSD-4-Clause License, so you can make **your own versions of it**, of course, if you follow the EULA.

I hope you like it, and you will find it easy to use!

For the source code, I recommend using PascalABC.NET version 3.4.2 build 2050, because it's the version I use, and the version it is compiled in. You can get it here: https://tinyurl.com/PascalABCNET
